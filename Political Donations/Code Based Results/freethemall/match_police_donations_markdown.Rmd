```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## set up environment
```{r}
#call packages into environment, install first if needed
library(tidyverse)
```

## import data into environment
```{r}
#import csvs for police names and for donations
##(I went into donations csv and changed amount column to numeric before this step)

donations <- read_csv("Donations.csv")
police <- read_csv("PoliceList-zips.csv")

#head function shows the top of each dataset
head(donations)
head(police)

```
## standardize names in each dataset

Names will be standardized by first splitting first and last names, then eliminating any middle initial, then changing all to lower case, and stitching back together again. For example, 'Abraham,Patrick Olaf' becomes 'patrick abraham.' 
```{r}
#standardize police names
##separate first and last, remove middle names
police <- police %>% 
  #split first and last
  mutate(x = NAME) %>% 
  separate(x, c("last", "first"), sep = ",") %>% 
  #remove middle initials
  mutate(first = str_replace_all(
    #this regular expression says remove anything that looks like 
    #space then letter then word boundary (removes initial) OR
    #any period (removes the period)
    first, "[[:space:]][[:alpha:]]\\b|\\.", ""))

##make lower case, stitch together into standardized name column
police <- police %>% 
  mutate(last = str_to_lower(last),
         first = str_to_lower(first), 
         name_std = paste(first, last, sep = " "))

#show results
police %>% select(NAME, name_std) %>% head()
```
```{r}
#standardize donation names
##separate first and last, remove middle names
donations <- donations %>% 
  #split first and last
  mutate(x = Contributor) %>% 
  separate(x, c("last", "first"), sep = ",[[:space:]]") %>% 
  #remove middle initials
  mutate(first = str_replace_all(
    first, "[[:space:]][[:alpha:]]\\b|\\.", ""))

##make lower case, stitch together into standardized name column
donations <- donations %>% 
  mutate(last = str_to_lower(last),
         first = str_to_lower(first), 
         name_std = paste(first, last, sep = " "))

#extract first five digits of zip so it matches police dataset
donations <- donations %>% 
  #subset first five of zip and store as a numeric
  mutate(zip5 = as.numeric(str_sub(Zip, 1, 5)))

#show results
donations %>% select(Contributor, name_std, zip5) %>% head()
```
## match donors to names of police
```{r}
#left join donations to names of police using both name and zip
donations_police_match <- donations %>% 
  inner_join(police %>% 
               #remove first and last from police database so not redundant
               select(NAME, name_std, POSTAL), 
             by = c('name_std' = 'name_std', 'zip5' = 'POSTAL'))

##show results
donations_police_match %>% select(Contributor, Date, Amount, Occupation) %>% head()

##add field for year
donations_police_match <- donations_police_match %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(str_sub(Date, -4, -1)))

#write out
write_csv(donations_police_match, "donations_police_match_3.csv")

```
```{r}
#check for issues with donation doubles
double_match <- donations_police_match %>% 
  select(Contributor, Date, Amount) %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(n()>1) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

## data exploration
```{r}
## how many different officers donated?
donations_police_match %>% select(Contributor) %>% n_distinct()

```
```{r}
## much did officers donate?
donations_police_match %>% summarise(sum(Amount))
```
```{r}
#how much did they donate each year in dataset?
donations_police_match %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(sum(Amount))
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
